## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
This project was developed as part of my assignment in the 'Object Orientated Programming' module. Project goals included developing a console application game, by making use of basic programming and OOP fundamentals.

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>
The user is able to select 3 different difficulty levels, each of which utilise a distinct text file and range from easy, medium and hard.

On startup user is presented with a menu, prompting them to select their choice of difficulty. Once selected, the game will start.

The program will then ask the user to make two inputs; the two words they would like to reveal. If the two words are matching, they will remain revealed. Else, the program will hide the words again. In both instances, an appropriate message will be displayed, indicating whether they got it write or wrong.
