# memory-game
Built in Java using NetBeans 8.2.
Developed as part of my summative assignment, for the 'Object Orientated Programming' module in my second year.

## Description
This project is a simple application, that replicates a word matching, memory game and is based entirely within the IDE console. 
The user is able to select 3 different difficulty levels, each of which utilise a distinct text file. These are:
* Easy
* Medium
* Hard
Essentially, the difficulty lies in the total number of words, found inside the external files, with the harder tiers containing more in comparison to the lower.
