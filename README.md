# Memory Game
Built in Java using NetBeans 8.2.

Developed as part of my summative assignment, for the 'Object Orientated Programming' module.
## Description
A simple application that replicates a word matching, memory game and is based entirely within the IDE console. 
The user is able to select 3 different difficulty levels, each of which utilise a distinct text file. These are:
* Small
* Medium
* Large

Essentially, the difficulty lies in the total number of words found inside the external files, with the harder tiers containing more words in comparison to the lower.
## How to use
On startup, user is presented with menu, prompting them to select their choice of difficulty. Once selected, the game will start and will present the game table. These will hide the words, using placeholders in the form of [XXXXXXXXXXXX].

The program will then ask the user to make two inputs; the two words they would like to reveal.

If the two words are matching, they will remain revealed. Else, the program will hide the words again. In both instances, an appropriate message will be displayed, indicating whether they got it write or wrong. 

Input validations are also present throughout to ensure robustness and code sustainability (with the exception of string inputs that will be amended later).
